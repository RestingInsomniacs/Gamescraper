# CUBE CODERS GAME DESCRIPTION SCRAPER

The cube coders amp server has a list of games that it can host. However, that list doesn't include a lot of information about the game which makes discovery hard. GameScraper takes the list of games that the server supports and then pulls data from steam to make discovery easier.
